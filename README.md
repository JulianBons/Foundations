## Successor Representation

This repositiory contains files we used for our project in the Foundations of Neural and Cognitive Modelling module at the University of Amsterdam. 
As a final project, we designed a Maze and tested how an agent using QLearning compares to an agent using Successor Representations in a variety of tasks. 
In the LatentLearning Nodebook, we compare their performance on a latent learning task.
